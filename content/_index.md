## Welcome to my blog

I'm a 30 something *"Principal Software Engineer"* on a perpetual journey to get better at being a developer, a father and a person. I plan to write about anything that infuences those areas.

Currently, this is a hastily put together blog, built on Zola, which is a rust based static site generator that I can quickly edit / build / publish right to github pages without much effort and most importantly, for free. Check out **[my blog](@/blog/_index.md)**
